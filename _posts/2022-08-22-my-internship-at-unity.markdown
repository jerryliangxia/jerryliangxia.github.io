Over the past four months I've worked as an intern at Unity Montréal, on the Licensing & Entitlement team. It was a very memorable experience, one where I grew as a developer, teammate and person. Here's a post dedicated to my internship at Unity this summer, and what I learned as a developer.

## Backend work

Although I can't give too much information on exactly what I did, I can give a high level overview of my backend work. I was able to set up a local version of the licensing client and server, and investigate issues from there. Over the course of two months, I created controllers that were capable of communicating multi-status data from a user (from the licensing client), to the licensing server, and back to the client again to be used. I documented my changes using Swagger API.

## Frontend work

Towards the end of my internship, I came to really appreciate React. Our team worked on Unity's licensing dashboard, which was an initiative I was looking forward to from the beginning.

I got used to several React conventions, and even went so far as teaching these practices to the developers on my team. I started off with small tasks, like creating components with mock data. After this, I moved on to code design with my mentor, and brainstormed efficient ways of structuring our file system. This taught me a lot about proper software architecture, and the pivotal role it plays in writing readable, understandable code.

I also communicated with our product designer on several occasions, making sure that his designs, from a developer's perspective, were feasible, recyclable and maintainable. This took a number of meetings to ensure.

At the end of these tasks, I created several pages and laid out the architecture for the Unity licensing dashboard. With this work, I'm happy to have created the foundation for which the website will be maintained.

## Some thoughts

I would not have written this post without appreciating the people that helped shape my experience. I got to know so many brilliant minds at Unity, whose talents are highly commendable. I look toward my mentor, Martin Bouchard, who helped me become a better programmer. His dedication as a mentor helped me overcome issues that made me a stronger developer, which I'm really grateful for.

Then there's my team. This includes my manager, Sébastien Parent (pictured to the left in black), who became an overseer of two teams over the course of my internship. His dedication as a senior developer, as well as his level of skill, was highly commendable. One of the things I'll miss are the discussions between him and Martin over my work; as I became more confident in my skills, it was fun to be a part of the conversation and play a bigger role in the team.

Here's a picture of the interns I worked with. We were over 40 in Montréal, and the biggest cohort the office has seen!

And Ricky, me and Eric at "Biercredi": where we have beer on tap every Wednesday ;)

This ends my post. I had a great time at Unity, and raise a toast to everyone I've gotten to know from there. I thank the recruitment team, the devs I worked with in licensing, and the WE team for making the experience what it was. Thank you Unity for an amazing summer, and teaching me so much about what a healthy workplace looks like!

Thanks for reading! Until the next one :)
