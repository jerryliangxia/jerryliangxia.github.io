Hi!

My name's Jerry :) I'm a Software Engineering student studying at McGill University. Right now, I'm in my third year.

### Tech

Before university, I had limited experience with the technology I use today. I was into a lot of graphic design, so becoming a developer was something that I took a leap of faith into. However, I knew at the very least, that I always loved dreaming up things. A lot of it early on had to do with physics and science, and in my sophomore year, I realized that the lines of logic I spun up were similar to how computer science works - knowing exactly where things go, how it all comes together to create some working system. And so the journey began.

I started off with what was fun - making small Javascript web games, then moving on to join McGill's Game Dev team, making 2D and 3D platformer games in Unity. I explored my interest in graphic design in McGill's Hack4Impact team, where I spun up wireframes for MU Montr√©al's CRM system, and did some frontend programming as well. It was all so new, and I found myself absorbed in the languages that communicated these processes. Then, in the summer of 2021, I learned extensively about backend development. This was at Gameloft Studios, where I helped maintain the online infrastructure behind Gameloft's games. There, I learned much more about agile development, APIs, team version control and what was meant by clean software implementation.

### Interests

I love expression. In the future, I hope to bring both creativity and technology together, because I think it's where I truly shine.

As for hobbies, I've been playing guitar for around five years, and love to sketch and draw. I'm mostly self-taught with drawing ([here](https://www.behance.net/jerryxia)'s the link to some of my artwork), and fully the case with guitar. I love to play all music (currently learning Good News by Mac Miller), and I'm trying to become more fluent in music theory so I can start writing my own songs :)
