Hi!

My name's Jerry. I'm a Software Engineering student studying at McGill University. Right now, I'm in my fourth year.

### Tech

When I started coding, I began with what was fun - making small Javascript web games, then moving on to McGill Game Dev, creating 3d games in Unity. I explored my interest in graphic design at McGill's Hack4Impact chapter, where I created Figma designs for MU Montr√©al's CRM system. Then, in the summer of 2021 I learned extensively about backend development at Gameloft Studios. My next internship was at Unity, which I finished this past summer.

### Interests

I love art. In the future, I hope to bring both creativity and technology together, because I think it's where I truly shine.

As for hobbies, I play guitar and piano casually, and love to sketch. I'm mostly self-taught with drawing ([here's](https://www.behance.net/jerryxia) a link to some of my artwork).
