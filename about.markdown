Hi!

My name's Jerry :) I'm a Software Engineering student studying at McGill University. Right now, I'm in my fourth year.

### Tech

Before university, I had limited experience with the technology I use today. I was into a lot of graphic design, so becoming a developer was something that I took a leap of faith towards. However, I knew I loved dreaming up things. A lot of it early on had to do with physics and science, and in my sophomore year, I realized that the lines of logic I spun up were similar to how computer science works - knowing exactly where things go, how it all comes together to create some working system.

When I started developing, I began with what was fun - making small Javascript web games, then moving on to join McGill's Game Dev team, making 2D and 3D platformer games in Unity (a company I'd later intern at!). I explored my interest in graphic design at McGill's Hack4Impact chapter, where I created Figma designs for MU Montr√©al's customer relational management system, and did some frontend programming as well. Then, in the summer of 2021, I learned extensively about backend development at Gameloft Studios. My next internship was at Unity, which I just finished this past summer.

### Interests

I love art. In the future, I hope to bring both creativity and technology together, because I think it's where I truly shine.

As for hobbies, I play guitar and piano casually, and love to sketch. I'm mostly self-taught with drawing ([here's](https://www.behance.net/jerryxia) a link to some of my artwork).
